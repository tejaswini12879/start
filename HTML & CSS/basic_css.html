<h3>Section-1</h3>
<p>Mental health, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is <em>"a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community".</em> According to <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> , mental health includes <em>"subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others".</em>From the perspectives of positive psychology or of holism, mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life and to create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how one defines "mental health". </p>

<p>
	Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood

	<h3>Section-3</h3>
	<p>
		Mental health is not something to take for granted, or to sweep under the rug. Depression can happen to anyone – even those individuals whom you think “have it all.” There is no time more important to focus on emotional well-being than around the holidays.
